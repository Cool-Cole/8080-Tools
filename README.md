## Intel 8080 CPU Emulator

This project is an emulator for the intel 8080 that is designed to be interfaced with. Once full emulation is
implemented I plan on implementing time travel debugging.

This emulator will be the backend for two projects I plan on creating, a GDB like debugger and an emulator for Space
Invaders.

Any feedback is welcome and constructive criticism is encouraged!

## TODO

- [x] Implement all opcodes (excluding special instructions that need to be handled at a higher level)
- [x] Run the emulator against a testing rom
- [ ] Run the emulator aginst multiple testing roms
- [ ] Implement a GDB like debugging interface
- [ ] Time Travel Debugging
